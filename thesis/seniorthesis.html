      <h3>Abstract</h3>
        This paper considers the problem of computing the Lex-Minimizer (also known as the Absolutely Minimal Lipschitz Extension), where one is given a finite graph along with fixed values at some vertices and needs to compute a value assignment to the rest of the vertices such that the assignment lexicographically minimizes the infinity norm of the value differences across edges (in other words, to compute a value assignment that is as smooth as possible). The Lex-Minimizer has very interesting structural properties such as uniqueness and the max-min gradient averaging property. The Lex-Minimization problem is also related to a variety of other well-studied problems such as the infinity-Laplacians, <i>p</i>-harmonic functions, and <i>&#8467;<sub>p</sub></i>-minimization.
      <p>
        Researchers have been using the Lex-Minimizer in various fields such as image processing and machine learning for the past few decades. However, before the recent development in [KRSS15] which presented fast algorithms that compute the Lex-Minimizer in expected time  <i>&Otilde;(mn)</i> (where <i>n</i> is the number of vertices and <i>m</i> is the number of edges in the graph), researchers have been using intuitive iterative algorithms to compute the Lex-Minimizer, which are not provably convergent, let alone efficient. Nonetheless, these iterative algorithms are worth investigating for the following reasons: (1) they are extremely easy to implement; (2) because they are deeply rooted in the structural properties of the Lex-Minimizer, they might lead to new discoveries, (in particular, about error bounds).
      <p>
        This paper discusses the structural properties of the Lex-Minimizer, presents a few iterative algorithms which are based on these properties, and proves the convergence of these algorithms for computing the Lex-Minimizer.
